# ReferenceTissue_CompartmentalAnalysis

Matlab Graphic User Interface (GUI) for compartmental analysis of tumor data based on reference tissue modelling. 

The code is based on the following publication:

*2018 M. Scussolini M, S. Garbarino, M. Piana, G. Sambuceti and G. Caviglia "Reference Tissue Models for FDG-PET Data: Identifiability and Solvability", IEEE Trans. Rad. Plasma Med. Sciences 99 

# Usage:
Code is written in Matlab R2015b and tested with versions up to R2019b. It requires the "Curve FItting Toolbox" to run.

run main.m file launches a Matlab GUI for tumor reference tissue modelling. It requires standard .voistat data. 
Test data can be found in the "data test" folder. Pictorial representation of the reference tissue compartmental models implemented (2D, (3+1)D and 2D2input) are available in the "models" folder, and accessible from the GUI itself.
